🚀 SpeedSense

SpeedSense is a modern, Windows-only network performance analyzer built on iperf3, designed to show real internet quality, not just raw speed.

It measures download & upload speed, latency under load, bufferbloat, jitter, packet loss, and overall connection quality in a clear, visual way.

✨ Features

🚀 Accurate TCP download & upload testing

⏱ Latency under load & bufferbloat detection

📊 Jitter, packet loss & TCP efficiency analysis

🌍 Smart automatic server selection (global servers)

📈 Live and final interactive graphs

🎮 Real-world ratings for gaming, streaming & video calls

🖥 Requirements

Windows 10 / 11 (64-bit)

Run as Administrator (required for accurate results)

No .NET installation needed (self-contained)

▶ How to Use

Download the ZIP from Releases

Extract it

Right-click SpeedSense.exe → Run as administrator

Click Start Test

The test completes in about 30 seconds.

🔐 Why Administrator Access?

SpeedSense needs Administrator permission to:

Measure latency accurately (ICMP)

Detect bufferbloat under load

Perform low-level TCP & MTU diagnostics

It does not install drivers, does not change system settings, and runs only while open.
